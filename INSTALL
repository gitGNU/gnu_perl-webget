System wide install

        Run makefile with appropriate parameters. The program is
        installed without any file extension.

            make help
            make DESTDIR= prefix=/usr/local install

Manual install:

        1. Copy bin/*.pl somewhere along $PATH or use

             make DESTDIR=$HOME prefix=/usr install

        2. Look at bin/*conf and apply ideas there and write your
           own configuration file (optional; not required)

End of file
