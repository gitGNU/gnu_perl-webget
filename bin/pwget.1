.IP "\fB\-C|\-\-Create\-paths\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C|--Create-paths"
Create paths that do not exist in \f(CW\*(C`lcd:\*(C'\fR directives.
.Sp
By default, any \s-1LCD\s0 directive to non-existing directory will interrupt
program. With this option, local directories are created as needed making
it possible to re-create the exact structure as it is in configuration
file.
.IP "\fB\-\-config \s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--config FILE"
This option can be given multiple times. All configurations are read.
.Sp
Read URLs from configuration file. If no configuration file is given, file
pointed by environment variable is read. See \s-1ENVIRONMENT\s0.
.Sp
The configuration file layout is envlained in section \s-1CONFIGURATION\s0 \s-1FILE\s0
.IP "\fB\-\-chdir \s-1DIRECTORY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--chdir DIRECTORY"
Do a \fIchdir()\fR to \s-1DIRECTORY\s0 before any \s-1URL\s0 download starts. This is
like doing:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    cd DIRECTORY
\&    pwget http://example.com/index.html
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-extract \-e\fR" 4
.IX Item "--extract -e"
Unpack any files after retrieving them. The command to unpack typical
archive files are defined in a program. Make sure these programs are
along path. Win32 users are encouraged to install the Cygwin utilities
where these programs come standard. Refer to section \s-1SEE\s0 \s-1ALSO\s0.

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-F|\-\-Firewall \s-1FIREWALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F|--Firewall FIREWALL"
Use \s-1FIREWALL\s0 when accessing files via ftp:// protocol.
.IP "\fB\-m|\-\-mirror \s-1SITE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m|--mirror SITE"
If \s-1URL\s0 points to Sourcefoge download area, use mirror \s-1SITE\s0 for downloading.
Alternatively the full full \s-1URL\s0 can include the mirror information. And
example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    \-\-mirror kent ... http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/foo/foo\-1.0.0.tar.gz
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-n|\-\-new\fR" 4
.IX Item "-n|--new"
Get newest file. This applies to datafiles, which do not have extension
\&.asp or .html. When new releases are announced, the version
number in filename usually tells which is the current one so getting
harcoded file with:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    pwget \-o \-v http://example.com/dir/program\-1.3.tar.gz
.Ve
.Sp
is not usually practical from automation point of view. Adding
\&\fB\-\-new\fR option to the command line causes double pass: a) the whole
http://example.com/dir/ is examined for all files and b) files
matching approximately filename program\-1.3.tar.gz are examined,
heuristically sorted and file with latest version number is retrieved.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-lcd\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-lcd"
Ignore \f(CW\*(C`lcd:\*(C'\fR directives in configuration file.
.Sp
In the configuration file, any \f(CW\*(C`lcd:\*(C'\fR directives are obeyed as they
are seen. But if you do want to retrieve \s-1URL\s0 to your current
directory, be sure to supply this option. Otherwise the file will end
to the directory pointer by \f(CW\*(C`lcd:\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-save\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-save"
Ignore \f(CW\*(C`save:\*(C'\fR directives in configuration file. If the URLs have
\&\f(CW\*(C`save:\*(C'\fR options, they are ignored during fetch. You usually want to
combine \fB\-\-no\-lcd\fR with \fB\-\-no\-save\fR
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-extract\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-extract"
Ignore \f(CW\*(C`x:\*(C'\fR directives in configuration file.
.IP "\fB\-O|\-\-Output \s-1DIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O|--Output DIR"
Before retrieving any files, chdir to \s-1DIR\s0.
.IP "\fB\-o|\-\-overwrite\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o|--overwrite"
Allow overwriting existing files when retrieving URLs.
Combine this with \fB\-\-skip\-version\fR if you periodically update files.
.IP "\fB\-\-Proxy \s-1PROXY\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--Proxy PROXY"
Use \s-1PROXY\s0 server for \s-1HTTP\s0. (See \fB\-\-Firewall\fR for \s-1FTP\s0.). The port number is
optional in the call:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    \-\-Proxy example.com.proxy.com

.Ve
.IP "\fB\-p|\-\-prefix \s-1PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p|--prefix PREFIX"
Add \s-1PREFIX\s0 to all retrieved files.
.IP "\fB\-P|\-\-Postfix \s-1POSTFIX\s0 \fR" 4
.IX Item "-P|--Postfix POSTFIX "
Add \s-1POSTFIX\s0 to all retrieved files.
.IP "\fB\-D|\-\-prefix\-date\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D|--prefix-date"
Add iso8601 \*(L":YYYY\-MM\-DD\*(R" prefix to all retrived files.
This is added before possible \fB\-\-prefix\-www\fR or \fB\-\-prefix\fR.
.IP "\fB\-W|\-\-prefix\-www\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W|--prefix-www"
Usually the files are stored with the same name as in the \s-1URL\s0 dir, but
if you retrieve files that have identical names you can store each
page separately so that the file name is prefixed by the site name.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    http://example.com/page.html    \-\-> example.com::page.html
\&    http://example2.com/page.html   \-\-> example2.com::page.html
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-r|\-\-regexp \s-1REGEXP\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r|--regexp REGEXP"
Retrieve URLs matching \s-1REGEXP\s0 from configuration file. This cancels
\&\fB\-\-Tag\fR options in the command line.
.IP "\fB\-R|\-\-Regexp \s-1REGEXP\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R|--Regexp REGEXP"
Retrieve file matching at the destination \s-1URL\s0 site. This is like \*(L"Connect
to the \s-1URL\s0 and get all files matching \s-1REGEXP\s0\*(R". Here all gzip compressed
files are found form \s-1HTTP\s0 server directory:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    pwget \-v \-R "\e.gz" http://example.com/archive/
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-A|\-\-Regexp\-content \s-1REGEXP\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A|--Regexp-content REGEXP"
Analyze the content of the file and match \s-1REGEXP\s0. Only if the regexp
matches the file content, then download file. This option will make
downloads slow, because the file is read into memory as a single line
and then a match is searched against the content.
.Sp
For example to download Emacs lisp file (.el) written by Mr. Foo in
case insesiteve manner:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    pwget \-v \-R \*(Aq\e.el$\*(Aq \-A "(?i)Author: Mr. Foo" \e
\&      http://www.emacswiki.org/elisp/index.html
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-\-stdout\fR" 4
.IX Item "--stdout"
Retrieve \s-1URL\s0 and write to stdout.
.IP "\fB\-\-skip\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--skip-version"
Do not download files that have version number and which already exists on
disk. Suppose you have these files and you use option \fB\-\-skip\-version\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    kit.tar.gz
\&    file\-1.1.tar.gz
.Ve
.Sp
Only file.txt is retrieved, because file\-1.1.tar.gz contains version number
and the file has not changed since last retrieval. The idea is, that in
every release the number in in distribution increases, but there may be
distributions which do not contain version number. In regular intervals
you may want to load those kits again, but skip versioned files. In short:
This option does not make much sense without additional option \fB\-\-new\fR
.Sp
If you want to reload versioned file again, add option \fB\-\-overwrite\fR.
.IP "\fB\-T|\-\-Tag \s-1NAME\s0 [\s-1NAME\s0] ...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T|--Tag NAME [NAME] ..."
Search tag \s-1NAME\s0 from the config file and download only entries defined
under that tag. Refer to \fB\-\-config \s-1FILE\s0\fR option description. You can give
Multiple \fB\-\-Tag\fR switches. Combining this option with \fB\-\-regexp\fR
does not make sense and the concequencies are undefined.
.Sh "Miscellaneous options"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous options"
.IP "\fB\-d|\-\-debug [\s-1LEVEL\s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d|--debug [LEVEL]"
Turn on debug with positive \s-1LEVEL\s0 number. Zero means no debug.
This option turns on \fB\-\-verbose\fR too.
.IP "\fB\-h|\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h|--help"
Print help page in text.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\-html\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help-html"
Print help page in \s-1HTML\s0.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\-man\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help-man"
Print help page in Unix manual page format. You want to feed this output to
c<nroff \-man> in order to read it.
.Sp
Print help page.
.IP "\fB\-s|\-\-selftest\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s|--selftest"
Run some internal tests. For maintainer or developer only.
.IP "\fB\-t|\-\-test\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t|--test"
Run in test mode.
.IP "\fB\-v|\-\-verbose [\s-1NUMBER\s0]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v|--verbose [NUMBER]"
Print verbose messages.
.IP "\fB\-V|\-\-Version\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V|--Version"
Print version information.
.SH "README"
.IX Header "README"
Automate periodic downloads of files and packages.
.Sh "Wget and this program"
.IX Subsection "Wget and this program"
At this point you may wonder, where would you need this perl program when
\&\fIwget\fR\|(1) C\-program has been the standard for ages. Well, 1) Perl is cross
platform and more easily extendable 2) You can record file download
criterias to configuration files and use perl regular epxressions to select
downloads 3) the program can anlyze web-pages and \*(L"search\*(R" for the download
only links as instructed 4) last but not least, it can track newest
packages whose name has changed since last downlaod. There is heuristics to
determine the newest file or package according to file name skeleton
defined in configuration.
.PP
This program does not replace \fIpwget\fR\|(1) because it does not offer as many
options as wget, like recursive downloads. Use wget for ad hoc downloads
and this utility for files that you monitor periodically.
.Sh "Short introduction"
.IX Subsection "Short introduction"
This small utility makes it possible to keep a list of URLs in a
configuration file and periodically retrieve those pages or files with
simple commands. This utility is best suited for small batch jobs to
download e.g. most recent versions of software files. If you use an \s-1URL\s0
that is already on disk, be sure to supply option \fB\-\-overwrite\fR to allow
overwriting existing files.
.PP
While you can run this program from command line to retrieve individual
files, program has been designed to use separate configuration file via
\&\fB\-\-config\fR option. In the configuration file you can control the
downloading with separate directives like \f(CW\*(C`save:\*(C'\fR which tells to save the
file under different name. The simplest way to retreive the latest version
of a kit from \s-1FTP\s0 site is:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    pwget \-\-new \-\-overwite \-\-verbose \e
\&       http://www.example.com/kit\-1.00.tar.gz
.Ve
.PP
Do not worry about the filename \*(L"kit\-1.00.tar.gz\*(R". The latest version, say,
kit\-3.08.tar.gz will be retrieved. The option \fB\-\-new\fR instructs to find
newer version than the provided \s-1URL\s0.
.PP
If the \s-1URL\s0 ends to slash, then directory list at the remote machine
is stored to file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    !path!000root\-file
.Ve
.PP
The content of this file can be either index.html or the directory listing
depending on the used http or ftp protocol.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"

.Sh "Comments"
.IX Subsection "Comments"
The configuration file is \s-1NOT\s0 Perl code. Comments start with hash character
(#).
.Sh "Variables"
.IX Subsection "Variables"
At this point, variable expansions happen only in \fBlcd:\fR. Do not try
to use them anywhere else, like in URLs.
.PP
Path variables for \fBlcd:\fR are defined using following notation, spaces are
not allowed in \s-1VALUE\s0 part (no directory names with spaces). Varaible names
are case sensitive. Variables substitute environment variabales with the
same name. Environment variables are immediately available.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    VARIABLE = /home/my/dir         # define variable
\&    VARIABLE = $dir/some/file       # Use previously defined variable
\&    FTP      = $HOME/ftp            # Use environment variable
.Ve
.PP
The right hand can refer to previously defined variables or existing
environment variables. Repeat, this is not Perl code although it may
look like one, but just an allowed syntax in the configuration file. Notice
that there is dollar to the right hand> when variable is referred, but no
dollar to the left hand side when variable is defined. Here is example
of a possible configuration file contant. The tags are hierarchically
ordered without a limit.
.PP
Warning: remember to use different variables names in separate
include files. All variables are global.
.Sh "Include files"
.IX Subsection "Include files"
It is possible to include more configuration files with statement
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    INCLUDE <path\-to\-file\-name>
.Ve
.PP
Variable expansions are possible in the file name. There is no limit how
many or how deep include structure is used. Every file is included only
once, so it is safe to to have multiple includes to the same file.
Every include is read, so put the most importat override includes last:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    INCLUDE <etc/pwget.conf>             # Global
\&    INCLUDE <$HOME/config/pwget.conf>    # HOME overrides it

.Ve
.IP "\fBnew:\fR" 4
.IX Item "new:"
Get newest file. This variable is reset to the value of \fB\-\-new\fR after the
line has been processed. Newest means, that an \fIls()\fR command is run in the
ftp, and something equivalent in \s-1HTTP\s0 \*(L"ftp directories\*(R", and any files that
resemble the filename is examined, sorted and heurestically determined
according to version number of file which one is the latest. For example
files that have version information in \s-1YYYYMMDD\s0 format will most likely to
be retrieved right.
.Sp
Time stamps of the files are not checked.
.Sp
The only requirement is that filename \f(CW\*(C`must\*(C'\fR follow the universal version
numbering standard for released kits:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Sp
\&\fB\s-1REMEMBER:\s0 All the regular epxression used in the configuration file have
a limitation of keeping together. This means that there must be no space
characters in the regular expressions, because it will terminate reading
the item.\fR Like if you write
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    pregexp:(this regexp )
.Ve
.Sp
It must be written:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    pregexp:(this\es+regexp\es)
.Ve
.Sp
Read the \s-1HTTP\s0 url page \*(L"as is\*(R" and parse page content. You need this
directive if the archive is not stored in \s-1HTTP\s0 server directory (similar
to ftp dir), but the maintainer has set up a separate \s-1HTML\s0 page where the
details how to get archive is explained.
.Sp
In order to find the information from the page, you must also supply
some other directives to guide searching and constructing
the correct file name:
.Sp
1) A page regexp directive \f(CW\*(C`pregexp:ARCHIVE\-REGEXP\*(C'\fR matches the A \s-1HREF\s0
filename location in the page.
.Sp
2) Directive \f(CW\*(C`file:DOWNLOAD\-FILE\*(C'\fR tells what is the template to use to
construct the downloadable file (for the \f(CW\*(C`new:\*(C'\fR directive).
.Sp
3) Directive \f(CW\*(C`vregexp:VERSION\-REGEXP\*(C'\fR matches the exact location
in the page from where the version information is extracted. The default
regexp looks for line that says \*(L"The latest version ...is.. 1.4.2\*(R". The
regexp must return submatch 2 for the version number.
.Sp
To put all together, an example shows more this in action. The following
example should all be \s-1PUT\s0 \s-1ON\s0 \s-1ONE\s0 \s-1LINE\s0, while it has been splitted to
separate lines for legibility. The presented configuration line is
explaind in next paragraphs.
.Sp
Contact absolute \fBpage:\fR at http://www.example.com/package.html and
search A \s-1HREF\s0 urls in the page that match \fBpregexp:\fR. In addition, do
another scan and search the version number in the page from thw
position that match \fBvregexp:\fR (submatch 2).
.Sp
After all the pieces have been found, use template \fBfile:\fR to
make the retrievable file using the version number found from
\&\fBvregexp:\fR. The actual download location is combination of
\&\fBpage:\fR and A \s-1HREF\s0 \fBpregexp:\fR location. Here is the whole \*(L"one line\*(R"
definition in the configuration file:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    http://www.example.com/~foo/package.html
\&    page:
\&    pregexp: package.tar.gz
\&    vregexp: ((?i)latest.*?version.*?\eb([\ed][\ed.]+).*)
\&    file: package\-1.3.tar.gz
\&    new:
\&    x:
.Ve
.Sp
Still not clear? Look at this complete \s-1HTML\s0 page where the above directives
apply:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    <HTML>
\&    <BODY>
\&
\&    The latest version of package is <B>2.4.1</B> It can be
\&    downloaded in several forms:
\&
\&        <A HREF="download/files/package.tar.gz">Tar file</A>
\&        <A HREF="download/files/package.zip">ZIP file
\&
\&    </BODY>
\&    </HTML>
.Ve
.Sp
For this example it is assumed that package.tar.gz is actually a symbolic
link to the latest standard release file package\-2.4.1.tar.gz. From this
page the actual download location would have been
http://www.example.com/~foo/download/files/package\-2.4.1.tar.gz So why not
simply download package.tar.gz? Because then the program can't decide if
the version at the page is newer than one stored on disk from the previous
download. With version numbers in the file names, it can.
.Sp
\&\s-1ANOTHER\s0 \s-1EXAMPLE\s0
.Sp
It is possible to add \fBrename:\fR directive to change the final name
of the saved file to the above cases. Sometimes people put version number
to \*(L"plain\*(R" files, that are not archives, like
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    file.el\-1.1
\&    file.el\-1.2
.Ve
.Sp
the .el files are Emacs editor packages files and it would be very
inconvenient for Emacs users to refer to those with any other name than
plain \*(L"file.el\*(R". To write a complete line to find such files from
a page and save them in plain name, see below. Lines have been broken
for legibility:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    http://example.com/files/
\&    page:
\&    pregexp:\e.el\-\ed
\&    vregexp:(file.el\-([\ed.]+))
\&    file:file.el\-1.1
\&    new:
\&    rename:s/\-[\ed.]+//
.Ve
.Sp
It effectively says \*(L"See if there is new version of something that
looks like file.el\-1.1 and save it under name file.el by deleting the extra
version number at the end of original filename\*(R".
.IP "\fBpage:find\fR" 4
.IX Item "page:find"
\&\s-1THIS\s0 \s-1IS\s0 \s-1NOT\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1FTP\s0 directories. Use directive \fBregexp:\fR for \s-1FTP\s0.
.Sp
This is more general instruction than the \fBpage:\fR and \fBvregexp:\fR
explained above.
.Sp
Instruct to download every \s-1URL\s0 on \s-1HTML\s0 page matching \fBpregexp:RE\fR. In
typical situation the page maintainer lists his software in the development
page. This example would download every tar.gz file mentined in a page.
Note, that the \s-1REGEXP\s0 is matched against the A \s-1HREF\s0 link content, not
the actual text that you see on the page:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.example.com/index.html page:find pregexp:\e.tar.gz$
.Ve
.Sp
You can also use additional \fBregexp-no:\fR directive if you want to exclude
files after the \fBpregexp:\fR has matched a link.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.example.com/index.html page:find pregexp:\e.tar.gz$ regexp\-no:this\-packet
.Ve
.IP "\fBpass:PASSWORD\fR" 4

.IP "\fBprint:MESSAGE\fR" 4
.IX Item "print:MESSAGE"
Print associated message to user requesting matching tag name.
This directive must in separate line inside tag.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    tag1: linux
\&
\&      print: this download site moved 2002\-02\-02, check your bookmarks.
\&      http://new.site.com/dir/file\-1.1.tar.gz new:
.Ve
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`print:\*(C'\fR directive for tag is shown only if user turns on \-\-verbose
mode:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    pwget \-v \-T linux
.Ve
.IP "\fBrename:PERL\-CODE\fR" 4
.IX Item "rename:PERL-CODE"
Rename each file using PERL-CODE. The PERL-CODE must be full perl program
with no spaces anywhere. Following variables are available during the
\&\fIeval()\fR of code:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $ARG = current file name
\&    $url = complete url for the file
\&    The code must return $ARG which is used for file name
.Ve
.Sp
For example, if page contains links to .html files that are in fact
text files, following statement would chnage the file extensions:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    http://example.com/dir/ page:find pregexp:\e.html rename:s/html/txt/
.Ve
.Sp
You can also call function \f(CW\*(C`MonthToNumber($string)\*(C'\fR if the filename
contains written month name, like <2005\-February.mbox>.The function will
convert the name into number. Many mailing list archives can be donwloaded
cleanly this way.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    #  This will download SA\-Exim Mailing list archives:
\&    http://lists.merlins.org/archives/sa\-exim/ pregexp:\e.txt$ rename:$ARG=MonthToNumber($ARG)
.Ve
.Sp
Here is a more complicated example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svnusers/mbox.cgi pregexp:mbox.*\ed$ rename:my($y,$m)=($url=~/year=(\ed+).*month=(\ed+)/);$ARG="$y\-$m.mbox"
.Ve
.Sp
Let's break that one apart. You may spend some time with this example since
the possiblilities are limitless.
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&    1. Connect to page http://www.contactor.se/~dast/svnusers/mbox.cgi
\&    2. Search page for URLs matching regexp \*(Aqmbox.*\ed$\*(Aq. A found link would
\&       could be
\&       http://svn.haxx.se/users/mbox.cgi?year=2004&month=12
\&    3. The found link is put to $ARG, which can be used to extract suitable
\&       mailbox name with perl code that is evaluated. The resulting name must
\&       apear in $ARG. Thus the code effectively extract two items from the
\&       link to form a mailbox name:
\&
\&        my ($y, $m) = ( $url =~ /year=(\ed+).*month=(\ed+)/ )
\&        $ARG = "$y\-$m.mbox"
\&
\&        => 2004\-12.mbox
.Ve
.Sp
Just remember, that there \fBmust\fR not be any spaces in the code that
follows \f(CW\*(C`rename:\*(C'\fR directive.
.IP "\fBregexp:REGEXP\fR" 4
.IX Item "regexp:REGEXP"
Get all files in ftp directory matching regexp. Directive \fBsave:\fR is ignored.
.IP "\fBregexp\-no:REGEXP\fR" 4
.IX Item "regexp-no:REGEXP"
After the regexp: directive has matched, explude files that match
directive \fBregexp-no:\fR
.IP "\fBRegexp:REGEXP\fR" 4
.IX Item "Regexp:REGEXP"
This option is for interactive use. Retrieve all files from \s-1HTTP\s0 or \s-1FTP\s0
site which match \s-1REGEXP\s0.
.IP "\fBsave:LOCAL\-FILE\-NAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "save:LOCAL-FILE-NAME"
Save file under this name to local disk.
.IP "\fBtagN:NAME\fR" 4
.IX Item "tagN:NAME"
Downloads can be grouped under \f(CW\*(C`tagN\*(C'\fR so that e.g. option \fB\-\-Tag1\fR would
start downloading files from that point on until next \f(CW\*(C`tag1\*(C'\fR is found.
There are currently unlimited number of tag levels: tag1, tag2 and tag3, so
that you can arrange your downlods hierarchially in the configuration file.
For example to download all Linux files rhat you monitor, you would give
option \fB\-\-Tag linux\fR. To download only the \s-1NT\s0 Emacs latest binary, you
would give option \fB\-\-Tag emacs-nt\fR. Notice that you do not give the
\&\f(CW\*(C`level\*(C'\fR in the option, program will find it out from the configuration
file after the tag name matches.
.Sp
The downloading stops at next tag of the \f(CW\*(C`same level\*(C'\fR. That is, tag2 stops
only at next tag2, or when upper level tag is found (tag1) or or until end of
file.
.Sp
.Vb 1

In the archive, all files are supposed to be stored under the proper

\&    package\-YYYY.MMDD

not to include any subdirectories, use this option to suppress creation
of an artificial root package\-YYYY.MMDD.
.IP "\fBxopt:rm\fR" 4
.IX Item "xopt:rm"
This options tells to remove any previous unpack directory.

This is not a serious error, because the archive was already on disk and
