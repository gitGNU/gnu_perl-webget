#    To make a Cygwin Net release
#
#	First, make world release. It is a preliminary step for Cygwin release
#
#	    make release-world
#
#	Now Cygwin binary and source packages can be done with:
#
#	    make RELEASE=1 release-cygwin-bin release-cygwin-source
#	    make publish
#
#   Cygwin build: How it all works?
#
#	Everything is done under .build/ directory where the released
#	tar files will appear. The first phase is to make world release.
#	You must do it first, because it copies everything under RELEASEDIR
#	which will be exact snapshot of the current package directory (or CVS
#	checkout)
#
#	    .build/package-YYYY.MMDD/		<< RELEASEDIR
#
#	Now, the cygbuild.sh tool will chdir _inside_ this RELEASEDIR directory
#	and will give all packaging commands from there. The results appear
#	one directory above (..), which efectively puts the created files in:
#
#	    .build/
#
#	The 'publish' command works similarly. It enters the RELEASEDIR and looks
#	Cygwin files one directory above (..) and copies them to the default
#	destination directory. This directory is usually configured to Web server
#	and it is seen to the outside world.
