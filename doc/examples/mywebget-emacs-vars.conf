#   Description
#
#       This is plug-in, to perl web download utility. This file
#       contains configuration setting for Emacs specific downloads.
#       You may include this file to toplevel `$HOME/conf/mywebget.conf'
#       before `mywebget-emacs.conf'. See next.
#
#   How to use this file
#
#       1) Copy this file to $HOME/conf/mywebget/emacs-vars.conf
#
#       2) Make the necessary directory location changes. You MUST change
#          the ROOT, where you want to keep the files. A good candidate
#          for site wide installation is /usr/share. In Windows environment
#          set this to something similar, like c:/share/site-lisp
#
#       3) DO NOT COPY mywebget-emacs.conf from the location where it is.
#          This is because the updates will appear to that file.
#
#       4) Create $HOME/conf/mywebget/mywebget.conf and set environment
#          variable PWGET_CFG to point to that location. Let the
#          file read:
#
#           # pwget.conf -- $HOME/conf/mywebget/pwget.conf
#
#           CONF = $HOME/conf/pwget
#
#           include <$CONF/emacs-vars.conf>
#           include <$CONF/emacs.conf>
#
#           # End of file
#
#       5)  Make sure perl finds pwebget along $PATH
#
#       If you just want to see the layout, without actuallu downloading
#       anything, use command:
#
#           perl -S pwebget -r no-match --Create-paths
#
#       After the directories are in place, leave this command running
#       for few hours and you get all the latest versions of Emacs
#       packages known to this configuration file.
#
#           perl -S pwget --verbose --overwrite --Tag elisp
#
# ........................................................................



#   Root directory of all downloads.
#   In site wide Unix this could be something like:
#
#       ROOT = /usr/share/emacs
#
#   !! YOU MUST CHANGE THIS VALUE, unless you're testing first.

ROOT            = $HOME/tmp

#   These "E" variables are used for Emacs downloads.
#   ESITE_LISP is the root directory under all Emacs Lisp packages are stored.

ESITE_LISP      = $ROOT/site-lisp

# The preferred Sourcefoforge download site.
# CHANGE this value to reflect mirror closest to you.
