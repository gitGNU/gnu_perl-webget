    Hi,

    I'm pleased to announce that the Perl utility `mywebget.pl', which
    can fetch URLs around the globe, has now moved to its own
    project at:

        Perl webget Project
        http://perl-webget.sourceforge.net/

    Now, what does that got to do with Emacs Lisp? The perl program
    was previously hosted under Emacs Tiny Tools project
    (<http://tiny-tools.sourceforge.net/>), but many may not have paid
    attention to the spicy perl program that lied under
    bin/mywebget.pl. The project included emacs webget configuration
    files that recorded all know Emacs Lisp developers who keep
    code in their Web pages or FTP directories.

    Since the webget project now has it's own page, it's easier to
    maintain and keep it up to date. Download the current release and
    be ready to fetch all the favourite Lisp tools available from
    those developers' sites.

    Further instructions, what it means to build /usr/share/site-lisp/net
    hierarchy is included in the package and in the sourceforge page.

    Please pay a visit and share your comments and improvements!

    If you're an Emacs Lisp developer and you're not yet in the
    configuration file yet, please step in and send email including
    the URL fro where your code can be found.

    Jari
