--text follows this line--

    Hi,

    I'm pleased to announce that the Perl utility `pwget.pl', which
    can fetch URLs around the globe, has now moved to its own
    project at:

        Perl webget Project
        http://freshmeat.net/projects/perlwebget

    Now, what does that got to do with Emacs Lisp? The project
    includes a configuration files that records known Emacs Lisp
    developers who keep code in their Web pages or FTP directories.

    Since the webget project now has it's own page, it's easier to
    maintain and keep it up to date. Download the current release and
    be ready to fetch all the favourite Lisp tools available from
    those developers' sites.

    Please pay a visit and share your comments and improvements!

    If you're an Emacs Lisp developer and you're not yet in the
    configuration file yet, please step in and send email including
    the URL fro where your code can be found.

    Jari
